    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a developer living in <strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>. It is my dream to work as a developer and learn as much as I can about coding and development. I've completed a web developer program and <strong>PCC</strong> and I am currently enrolled at <strong>Epicodus</strong>. I presently run a dog walking business in Portland. I decided to take the course at Epicodus because I wanted to learn more about modern development techniques and coding languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current intrests are video games, reading, and hanging out with my dog <em>Guffy</em>.
